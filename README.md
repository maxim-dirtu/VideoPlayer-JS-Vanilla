# VideoPlayer-JS-Vanilla
A project developed for the university course in the third year - Multimedia, using a mandatory stack of Vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap CSS.

## Description
Allows users to watch a collection of at least 4 movies, statically stored within the application in the "media" folder.

## Features
- **Playlist Navigation:** Users can navigate through the playlist with the ability to automatically transition to the next film.
- **Adding New Movies:** Users can add new movies either through drag and drop or using an input control.
- **Video Drawing and Semitransparent Controls:** The video and semitransparent controls (previous, play/pause, next, progress bar, and volume) are drawn on the same canvas, overlaying the video stream. The functionality is determined based on the cursor's position within the canvas.
- **Preview Frame Functionality:** When the cursor is above the progress bar, a preview frame functionality is implemented.
